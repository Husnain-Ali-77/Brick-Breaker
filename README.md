Game Assembly Code
Overview
This repository contains assembly language code written in x86 assembly for a simple game. The game involves tracking scores, levels, and the positions of various game elements. The code is structured to handle different levels of difficulty, manage player lives, and provide feedback to the player.

File Structure
hz.asm: The main assembly file containing the entire game logic, including score management, level progression, and display messages.
Code Sections
Data Segment:
Defines all the variables used in the game, such as finalscore, x_cord, y_cord, level_counter, scoretheek variables, and many others for managing game states and display.
Stack Segment:
Handles the memory stack setup necessary for the game's execution.
Code Segment:
Implements the main game logic, including initializing the game, updating player positions, calculating scores, and handling user inputs.
How to Assemble and Run
Assembler: Use an x86 assembler like MASM or NASM to compile the .asm file.

bash
Copy code
nasm -f bin hz.asm -o game.com
Emulator: If you are on a modern machine, you may need to use an emulator like DOSBox to run the compiled binary.

bash
Copy code
dosbox game.com
Features
Score Tracking: The game tracks the player's score and updates it as they progress.
Level Progression: There are multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty.
User Feedback: Messages like "GAME OVER", "PRESS ANY KEY TO PLAY", and "PLEASE! PLAY AGAIN :)" provide feedback to the player.
Dependencies
x86 Assembler: MASM, NASM, or any other assembler supporting x86 assembly.
DOSBox: Recommended for running the game on modern operating systems.
